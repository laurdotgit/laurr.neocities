        2024 Writing Challenge - January
      </center></h2>
      <p style="text-indent:1rem;">
Happy New Year! I’m resuming daily centuries into 2024, now as part of a larger group undertaking a <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/writingchallenge2024/">2024 Writing Challenge</a> (title vague purposefully). I’ll have an index of those participating soon! The rules I’m setting for myself are:
<br>
<li>write and post at least 6 days a week (ideally 7)</li>
<li>keep each standard post to 96-100 words</li>
<li>at least once a week, write something inspired by another writer's post</li>
<li>on sunday, to end the week, one post of unrestricted length which I’ll write over the course of the week</li>
<li>follow the week’s theme when possible! (themes decided... somehow? once weekly)</li>
      </p>

      <p class="centuryp">
        A glimpse of the late afternoon sun off the window across the street. The light is warmer, suddenly. Look up, and the clouds are deeper, richly textured. There’s colour creeping though the grey and white. The bricks and powerlines and branches glow silently. Something psychological, some trick of optics, the relief of the world growing softer on the eyes ever so briefly. No need for why, just enjoy it.
      </p>

        Day 54 - Get to know it
      </a></h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
        You can’t really know your city until you’ve walked it. Get to know the kilometres of asphalt personally. Sand yourself down against it. Get physical with it. If you want to really get to know your city, you need to drink from the storm drains. Tear down a skyscraper brick by brick and blunt your teeth on its steel skeleton. Tag smooth cement walls with your blood and spit. Let your body flake away to nothing, your water seeping into the sewers, your carbon staining the sidewalks, your bones buried under six feet of concrete, cables, and wastewater pipes.

      </a></h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
        Saw my first PWHL game yesterday, and it was a fantastic experience, completely unlike any hockey I’ve watched before. A fresh league, new teams and systems and relationships and line combinations, just free-flowing skill expression against the chaos of the bouncing puck and steadiness of the goaltender. I love the entrenched meta of the NHL, the effortless weaving and passing of a long-established and unified group, but this felt much more expressive and energetic. And you can tell they’re having fun with it too! Seeing these teams really come together over the next few years will be a joy to watch.

      <p class="centuryp">
        Clank! Cla-thunk!<br><br>

        You dash down the flight of stairs and whip around to the left. Another identical stretch. The last flight was 48 steps. This one counts... clank! You thump down past another mosaic of chipped red and brown bricks. 51. <br><br>

        Stop, catch your breath. There’s no rhythm to the numbers, no pattern on the walls. Glancing down over the railing, the irregular square staircase spirals down into the darkness.<br><br>

        Chrrr-clack! From above. Far above. You’ve bought yourself an hour, probably. Your left knee needs lubrication. Your spine is still too stiff.<br><br>

        You might be able to keep this up. You have to.<br><br>

        The streetlights are still on over the fenced-off bridge across the river, and I notice them from the moving windows of the train at the station just up the hill. When have I last seen something so inviting? The night is cold and the currents are windy and chunks of ice are swirling in turbulent patterns along the shoreline. The path beckons. Eerie, seeing what was warm and green now cloaked in snow and shadow, set against the dull roar of the distant dam’s falls. Why not? We’re here, and in this weather a moving body gathers no frost.

        there are snowflakes in the air outside and a couple walking home and a cold wind is whistling through dormant branches and inside a cat is running down the 11th stair and the food bowl is almost empty and someone is dicing celery in the kitchen and in another room the 327th page is being turned and the kettle is cooling next to two half-drunk mugs of tea on the table and warm air is drifting out from the shower and if you look very carefully you can see the same thing happening everywhere across all of space in perfect unison.

        Oh I understand now. I’m starting to sense the shape of the core feelings and ideas I want to convey through writing. And there’s this one theme of the feeling of <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/writingchallenge2024/january#56-descent">spaces</a> and <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/century-a-day-dec23#48-clouds">sight-lines</a> and <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/century-a-day-dec23#34-the-bridge">scale</a> that I need to get out, I need to make you understand, and I see that writing isn’t quite the right medium for that. There could be so much more detail and nuance conveyed through a directly visual form. Fuck, I’m going to need to learn to make digital art or something, aren’t I? Making art is a slippery slope towards becoming an artist.

Assign each work a score from 0-5 on each of these scales:
<br>
<li><a title="not how much impact the characters have on the plot, but how much of the story is characters acting vs being forced to react. how much time to they spend getting out of situations? The Martian ranks very high here, while more Star Trek stories score very low." style="color: #946ccc;">Guy in a Situation:</a> How much agency do the characters have in the story?</li>
<li><a title="pretty self-explanatory. something like Asimov’s Foundation gets a low score, because only small parts of the vast story are ever relevant, but James S.A. Corey’s The Expanse has a very thorough, breathing world that is always being interacted with" style="color: #946ccc;">Homework:</a> How much detail is given to the worldbuilding? Are the details background/flavour or central to the story?</li>
<li><a title="this one’s fun because it can change drastically over the course of a series (see: The Three-Body Problem). I’m considering absolute time here, as one human’s lifespan extended for millions of years through cryogenics or time dilation is still a long story" style="color: #946ccc;">Purview:</a> What is the scale of the story being told, in space and time?</li>
<li><a title="this is where things like extended lifespans show up. This one is a bit harder to explain, but some books like Children of Time or Annihilation fuck around with perspective enough (be it by warping time or the actual senses the story is perceived through) that you can’t approach it the same way you can The Odyssey or The Lord of the Rings. high scores in this category are my favourite!" style="color: #946ccc;">Narrative Fuckery:</a> Is the story told from a perspective which is comparable to a classical human story?</li>
<li><a title="this might be a bit specific, but there’s a large divide between stories that investigate the human perspective they’re told in, and ones that don’t. or, if the story has non-human perspectives, does it try to do interesting things with those different perspectives like Children of Time, or keep things relatively simple like Hichhiker’s guide to the Galaxy?
  " style="color: #946ccc;">Monstrosity:</a> How important is recognizing humanity or inhumanity in the story’s characters to its themes?</li>
<li><a title="counts for any eroticism, implied or explicit. I like it when an author is able to look these kinds of concepts in the eye when crafting their stories, even if it’s ultimately sidelined. I’m thinking of Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2312 as a Sci-Fi book that doesn’t have sex central to the story but really benefits from having some in it. Also, hot.

Ok I’ve never done vector graphics before but what if I really fuck up the i? Just pulverize that little dot. Ohhhh those are fun errors. I love computers. I’ll try again tomorrow.

        My family is the crew who keeps the ship running. Grandma was a weaver, cobbling together a loom, an actual loom, from ruined doorframe parts. Pulling fibres from the organic waste cycle until the ship realized something was being withheld. Our entire family tree is supposed to be a closed system. She was still able to rip apart the prefab jumpsuits to make me a gown for my 16th birthday, but those strands don’t last long without machine precision. She doesn’t weave anymore. She’ll die soon, and no one else can work her loom the same way. It’ll die with her.

Week 3: Positive changes to mental condition replaced by discomfort and unease towards one’s current life, and deep resentment for those who have enacted recent change</li><li>
Weeks 4-5: Increasing paranoia, and withdrawing from those the patient has not known long</li><li>
Weeks 6+: Patients inevitably disappear from their lives, in search of a childhood home that no longer exists</li>

        Day 65 - The Baker
      </h4>
      <p style="text-indent:2rem;"><b>CW: Blood</b></p>
      <p class="centuryp">
        There’s a woman who’s leaving her apartment the day after a big storm, and she slips on the stairs just past the front door and falls really bad. Her leg’s broken in a really ugly way, and an artery burst and there’s blood spraying out all over the snow. But don’t worry, it’s not dangerous, people see this happen and rush to help her. But what are you supposed to do with all this bloody snow? You can’t mop it up, it’s freshly fallen, and the blood’s all seeped in. If you cover it up it’s still there, and the snow’s going to melt eventually. Do you shovel it up and throw it in a garbage bag? Take it into your home and melt it, then wash it down the sink? This isn’t a metaphor for anything, at least not on purpose, and it’s not very important anyway. Her neighbours deal with it, somehow. I brought up the snow to distract you from the woman’s leg, and her pain, because she’s in really bad shape. And now it’s ok! Because she’s in the ambulance and not in any danger, and she’s going to get a metal rod implant, and a bunch of physical therapy, and then she’s going to live for fifty-three more years. And the doctors told her she’d probably have a limp, but after a little while it’s not even noticeable. She doesn’t think about the blood-soaked snow when she comes home three days later; it’s all been cleared up and she’s more focused on getting up the stairs in a cast. Someone shovelled them clear a few days ago, thankfully, but her sister doesn’t know who. And after the first week it’s much less painful and more boring, and she watches some new shows, and learns how to knit but doesn’t really enjoy it. Her sister and her friends help out, when she needs it, and eventually they’ve sorted things out. Seven years later her friend’s mother breaks her hip, and she fishes her crutches out of the bathroom closet to save them eighty dollars. And fourty-one years later, she’s most well-known in the community for her baking, and this doesn’t matter much anymore at all.

        Day 66 - The Cities
      </a></h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
        There have been thousands of cities built over millennia of complex human societies, and the grandest have always been built alongside Ley Lines. These magical features of geography, stretching far across the globe, encompass vast quantities of arcane energy, and are sources and sinks for the surrounding landscape. The land breathes through the Ley Lines, and thus is shaped by them. The people of the cities draw from this mystical force to power their machines, grow their crops, and transport themselves long distances effortlessly. Many cities are built at the confluence of two Lines, where their powers are multiplied. These municipalities become hubs of learning, of trades and commerce, with their influence reaching far down multiple axes. Despite a constant presence of the Ley’s energies in their lives, the people of the cities know nothing about their magical properties. They simply call them rivers.

        No, I don’t feel like I’m in my 20s. I was born this summer, when my first needle pierced me. I was born last January, when I took on my name, and I was born three months previous when I found it. I was born six years ago, when I realized something was wrong, and I was born two years ago, when I realized what it was. I was born three weeks ago, when I didn’t recognize the person in the photos in my parent’s house.  And I’ll be born again tomorrow, when the sun rises and I wake slightly more full.

        Day 69 - Metro
      </a></h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
        The station is bitterly cold, and the train pull in an oasis of warmth and light. I flood into the arteries of the city, rejoining the crowds. The discomforts of the bus and the metro are known and comforting next to the stresses of student life. There’s nothing expected of me in the hour between class and home, and nothing I can do but rest, and watch. In the dark, city lights flash by. Transfer. My body sways gently with the carriage. Transfer. Familiar stations, each their own work of art, fade past in sequence. What says home more than a three-note chime?

      <p class="centuryp">
        There were numerous plans for this year, many of them open-ended fill-in-the-blanks, but Penny was not one of them. She just sort of showed up in my apartment one day, without personally having a say in the matter, and left me no choice but to make sure I kept her. As a casual actor she doesn’t do very much, but the impact she’s made amongst me and my friends is incredible. Is she doing this on purpose? Does she know? Was she sent here like an Istari, to guide us without telling us of her origins? I don’t think she’ll reveal anything.

      <p class="centuryp">
        How to make a good pot of soup:<br>

<ul>Step 1: Move to a new city
</ul><ul>Step 2: Struggle to adapt. Feel constantly overwhelmed
</ul><ul>Step 3: Cook an old family recipe. Do it poorly, and dislike it
</ul><ul>Step 4: Over many iterations, tweak it ever closer to your tastes
</ul><ul>Step 5: Get to know the recipe (your recipe) and its ingredients. Engineer better timings, ratios, spice combinations
</ul><ul>Step 6: Wait until a cold day in December
</ul><ul>Step 7: Forget to eat for 10 hours
</ul><ul>Step 8: At 11pm, once you are alone in the kitchen, start cooking
</ul><ul>Step 9: By now the recipe is routine, but don’t let it be. Remember the effort it took to get here
</ul><ul>Step 10: Let simmer for 30 minutes
</ul><ul>Step 11: Savour the taste, and the accomplishment. Don’t forget to sob over the bowl, letting adulthood fully sink in
</ul><ul>Step 12:  Share leftovers with friends</ul></p>
      <p class="smaller">
        note: no matter how many times you re-make this recipe, no bowl will ever taste as good as this one. In the moment, you will know this. Make sure you never stop trying anyways

        When I was little, I was obsessed with space. The rockets we've sent inspired awe in my eyes, tracing historical trails skywards. Beyond their consequences, this gazing 'up' holds beauty. It's so cold. The car has gone quiet. And now, beside you, I face a sky the likes of which I have never seen before. The glow of the snow caresses its edges with wisps of dull magenta and purple but remains pricked with the sharp light of ages long past. I hold your hand as we watch a dance that has already faded into legend play before us, here.

        #5: Freezing rain! Completely transforms the world, and rare enough it’s always a special occasion. Oh you can’t walk on ice, or need to “drive”? That’s unfortunate actually, sorry. It passes quickly. Y’know, forget the other four, this is a freezing rain appreciation century now. The way the trees glisten like their branches have been turned to glass! The streets a kaleidoscope of gleaming asphalt and concrete. And the crunch! Stepping through the thin layer of ice on fresh now underneath and seeing it fracture underfoot. Sliding the shell off a railing when you’re the first one out the door.

        Droplets of water fly upwards onto the shrinking stalactites above. Across the plain, mercifully, the tower of bone begins to rot, slowly being unmade by the same natural forces that brought it into being. Its glass melts back into sand, joining the endless dunes growing across the landscape. Victory has a price, and that price will be regrowing life from this once again dead world. In truth, this victory is nothing more than a long truce. This conflict cannot truly end. The spinning sun comes to a halt just above the horizon, and you are left with a shattered watch in your palm.

      <p class="centuryp">
        When I think of this last November, I think of myself in the living room, my laptop sitting under a lamp, wandering in circles pondering today’s century. It was novel, it was exciting, it felt productive, and it was a beautiful end to whatever messy day I had survived. I think, in the weeks since, routine has gotten the better of me. I’ve let this become a task instead of a joy. It’s not easy to keep a daily habit so long, and discipline begets joylessness at times, but there must be a way. I’ll get those evenings back again.

        As you watch, the rivers straighten and narrow, their flow growing more concentrated. Water drips upwards from the pools below to join the rapidly shrinking stalactites above. Before your eyes, the mountains straighten their backs and stretch upwards, unburdened by the weight of eons. Beneath them, the earth tears itself apart at the seams as continental plates go their separate ways. The atmosphere thins, and the rapidly shifting forests recede and shrink, devolving into ferns before rejoining the oceans. In the sky, almost imperceptibly, a handfuls of stars dim, then wink out. In bright flashes, a few more join.

others are walking behind me, turn the doorknob, and walk past me. others run through the door. others linger, before they too open the door. </p><p>

one time, when i was a kid, i ran towards a door. i looked behind me, and promptly slammed my face into the doorjamb. </p><p>

maybe i'm supposed to hold the door open. maybe i'm supposed to remove the hinges. maybe i'll leave and kick at the drywall.</p><p>

        Today I woke up and 12 years had passed. Awful timing, I had just finished arranging the raspberry bushes, and now the whole garden’s long overgrown with weeds. After such a busy night, time tries to correct itself. It’ll be a few weeks before another day passes, but I’ll have my hands full getting things straight ‘til then. Oh, come to think of it, the wine I brewed last week is gonna to be aged beautifully already! Or maybe I’ll crack open a bottle of that 93-year old brew I made last year, for motivation’s sake. It’ll be a long short day.

        Despite incredible advancements in medical technology, it became clear that the 560 year limit on the human mind could never be overcome. The body could be made to last forever, of course, and so the quest for immortality became a quest for continuity. Every half-millenia one’s mind would be swapped out for a fresh one, untarnished by years of consciousness. The new mind would be put to the task of relearning what the old one had left, through instilled memories and holo-recordings. Some refreshes would be seamless, hardly noticeable, and some were left unrecognizable. Suffice to say the philosophers were thrilled.
