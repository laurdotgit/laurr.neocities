        2024 Writing Calendar - March
      </center></h2>
      <p style="text-indent:1rem;">
        Starting March off strong with my 100th century! I planned to swap to a new challenge ruleset at 100, but it snuck up on me and I’ve got . Writing 100 word entries still brings me joy, but I’d like to shake things up a little. Write some longer-form stuff. Write some stories! Do some worldbuilding. Write more follow-ups to previous entries. And of course more colabs and author swaps with my Writchal co-conspirators. I’ll ease up on the word counting and the daily posting. I’m in this for the full 12 months (and beyond), no need to rush. Thank you for reading!

        Day 100 - Century / Soup IV
      </h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
        My friends have gone home, the pots and mugs and cutting boards have been washed up, and tonight one things remains. Penny settles down at the top of her tree, the lights dim, the dishwasher hums, a blank page opens on my screen, and I’m alone on the couch with my words. 100 is a meaningful achievement to me, but today is just routine. I’ve had this exact evening, with the distinct calm it brings, a few times since November 1st. Maybe tomorrow I’ll write of passion, or ideas, or wit, dreams or fantasies, but tonight is simple and peaceful.

        Day 101 - Review of The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russel

        Woah I finally got around to writing one of those book reviews I've been meaning to! For longer writing like this I'm going to give it its own page, so you can find my review <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/blog/the-sparrow-review">here!</a>

      <p class="centuryp">
               You want a branch that’s just the right length for the required style of casting: wands for quick hexes, staves for rituals and composites, and longstaffs for deep, complex magic (all hardwood channels are refereed to collectively as staffs). In general, the larger the volume of wood, the higher the capacity, but the slower the flow density. Most mages will carry one of each, but it’s possible to specialize further, especially with runes and flow-carvings. </p><p class="centuryp">

Despite the claims of your local merchant, the species of tree is irrelevant to mana flow, leaving it an aesthetic or sentimental choice. It’s a simple fact of nature that the capillary density of all trees stay more or less constant across any complete cross-section, regardless of species, age, or branch radius, and thus the only factors worth considering are the dimensions of the staff. It is of course important to choose wood from a tree that has grown in healthy conditions, unless you’re crafting a custom instrument for a niche use-case.

      </h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
        It is argued that the largest advantage to using a hardwood staff is accessibility. Arboreal biology is well-understood and remarkably consistent, and so the magical capabilities of hardwood channels are thoroughly documented. The standardization of magical practice makes education and experimentation significantly simpler than more chaotic methods, and has led to the growth of modern schools of magic. Accessibility also refers to the ease of acquiring such a channel; in theory any twig on the ground can be a channel, and even made into a powerful one after a few minutes of smoothing and a single sealing coat, compared to the thousands of hours it can take to weave a full battle-dress.

      </h4>
      <p class="centuryp">
Hardwood staffs are by far the most common channels in the betweenlands due to the mana-guiding abilities of naturally occurring fibrous capillary networks found in nearly all hardwood species, but the range of possible instruments is limitless. A battle-dress, woven of individual fibrous strands, presents an entirely different style of casting. Each strand has very little capacity for mana, but weave enough together, and you get a<mark> powerful </mark>and flexible channel. 
</p><p>
Hardwood staffs are known for their power, with all their capillaries in parallel allowing for very high mana flow, but the channel itself is dead, static. Hardwood mages require external patterns for complex

        Today's post is just me showing off my fancy little aside box I've made :3 I love websites I love the customizability of html, I want more texture to my pages beyond lines of formatted text. I'll use this for extra context and elaboration, maybe some little tangents if I so desire. I'm persuing the dream of making my website have its own methods of communication, tricks and tools I can use to make you digest my words in the way I intend.

spells, be they sigils, incantations, or even secondary channels like magnifying stones. A battle-dress is flexible, and while the topography of a dress cannot change once it is completed, it moves in consortium with the mage’s body, granting a continuously shifting landscape of mana flow. The name battle-dress comes from the rhythmic dance a mage uses in combat, with their channel changing form as they shift across the field.
</p><p>
The pattern woven into a battle-dress is similar to flow-carvings on the surface of a hardwood staff. Like flow-carvings, a dress is infinitely customization, woven to suit every possible need of it creator. Battle-dress mages wear their intentions on their sleeves, literally, as the spirals of a combat mage are easily distinguished from the sharp cuts of a transmutation mage, or the tiling patterns of an enchantment mage.

        Day 107 - Eye Contact
      </h4>
      <p class="centuryp" style="margin-left: 8%">
        It’s hard to take a picture of a cat. They’re always in motion, full of angles obscured by fur that catch the light in a particular way. Penny’s always been one for eye contact. Long, continuous, communicative eye contact. Across the bedroom, down a hallway, out under the couch. See and be seen. It’s hard enough to take a normal picture of a cat, but these glances are something you could never capture in a lens. She never looks into the camera the same way she looks at you. She can’t pretend the way a person can. It’s always genuine.
