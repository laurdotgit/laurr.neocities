    <p>Currently I'm doing a group <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/writingchallenge2024/">2024 Writing Challenge</a>, with friends and other co-conspirators! Century a Day was a great time, so I'm tweaking the rules for myself before jumping back into it with a bunch of others! You can find my writings <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/writingchallenge2024/january">here</a>. If you like this idea, give it a shot yourself, or reach out to <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/about-me">myself</a> or <a href="https://woah.encours.xyz/posts/writchalinfo.html">alice</a> if you want to be involved!<p>
    <p>
      I did a Century a Day challenge for <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/century-a-day">November</a> and <a href="https://laurr.neocities.org/century-a-day-dec23">December</a> 2023! You can find my old writings there.

      This website is a project on its own! It's an art project, a journal, a place to share things I like, and a space to mess around with javascript, css, html, and maybe some other things in.
